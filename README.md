# daimtronics
This is the repository for Daimtronics code covering the control of the soon-to-be autonomous model semi-truck. 

The project is split into 3 different sections: 

(1) semi_catkin_workspace: ROS (Robotic Operating System) C++ code that runs on a Raspberry 
Pi is found here. 

(2) simulink_models: folder where users can create and save files to eventually be 
converted to code that is input into the ROS system. 

(3) teensy_chibios: all of the code that runs on the Teensy. It is based on the ChibiOS RTOS.
